I like hacking together code and getting things to work in unexpected ways. This website is a way for me to vent my thoughts and share my learning from projects and other hacky endeavors I undertake.

My recent interests have taken me off the beaten path of web development and into the realm of AI and data processing, so I must finally be trending.

Currently there is a laundry list of things I want to build, but I am always open to new ideas and projects. If you have something interesting in mind, feel free to reach out to me.
