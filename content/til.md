You can find code for a browser extension by looking at the path `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/<Profile N>/Extensions` on OSX.
A simple bash command to find the path is:
```sh
latest_plugin=$(find "$CHROME_EXTENSIONS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name "*Temp" ! -name "*Extensions" -exec stat -f '%B %N' {} + | sort -nr | tail -n 1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
```

I use fish shell so interpolation of commands is different but you don't need to use your default shell, you can pass it into the shell that works.
A quick way to grab and triage recent screenshots from your desktop is by using the command line:
```sh
zsh -c "find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \"<regex| eg *.png>\" -mtime -<days-ago|eg 2> -exec mv {} ~/Pictures/Screenshots \;"
```

Converting build from `webpack` to `vite` is tricky because some loaders are not supported, and the structure is not one to one translatable. Tried it with `wasm` from [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/hello-world.html) and the build config for `vite` is as follows:
```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import wasm from "vite-plugin-wasm";

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        wasm(),
    ],
    root: "<root-of-js-loader>",
    build: {
        target: "esnext"
    }
});
```

In order to send keys from lua to nvim you need to use the following nested syntax, and if you want to separate it into a function:
```lua
_G.send_keys = function(keys)
    vim.api.nvim_feedkeys(vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes(keys, true, true, true), 'n', true)
end
```

You can  run a `git add -N example.txt` to allow you to perform stage hunks in the file even if it is a new file in the repo, ie via `git add -p example.txt`.

I have been somewhat misusing :thinking: _"It's turtles all the way down"_ probably. The new context I have learned about is that of a nonsensical circular logic argument that does not rely on a root supporting objectively accepted fact.

You can create arbitrarily sized files from the cli using one of the following commands
```sh
# create a 1GB file
dd if=/dev/zero of=1GBfile bs=1M count=1024

# create a 1GB file
head -c 1G /dev/urandom > 1GBfile.txt

# create a 1GB file
truncate -s 1G 1GBfile
```

There is a new OSS library called `ScrapeGraphAI` that aims to combine scraping with graph logic to transform natural language into scrapers, wodnering how this will work out in the long run.

# TIL: 1st June 2024

There is a submodule in the `go` standard library that allows you to do logging so it is not necessary to use `logrus` for logging.

You can run `chromedriver` from the command line for trying to access it via cdp protocol programatically.
```sh
# on OSX by default this does not work, developer not verified
chromedriver --port=9222

# OSX prior to running that
cd /path/to/chromedriver
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver
```

Rust zola static site builder contains in the page object a reading time field that can be used to display the reading time of the page. You can use it in the template like this

```jinja
{{ page.reading_time }}
```

In order to use shortcodes in Zola templates you need to import them using `include` directive in the template file.

```jinja
{% include "shortcodes/shortcode.html" %}
```

You can figure out number of commits today in git using a simple one liner
```bash
git log --since=midnight --oneline | wc -l
```

The [`go-spew`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew) package has been active last more than 7 years ago. You can use the [`litter`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sanity-io/litter) package instead. But no point in using it, just use `json.MarshalIndent` to print the struct in a readable format, or alternatively use `fmt.Printf("%#v", struct)` to print the struct in a readable format.

```go
    fmt.Printf("%#v", targets)
    // or
    jsonStr, _ := json.MarshalIndent(targets, "", "  ")
    fmt.Println(string(jsonStr))
```

_Anchor estimates_ are what you do when you try to shoehorn personal experience into estimating a future task.
It is very error prone.

When you load svg icons from a svg sprite, you can use the `use` tag to reference the icon by its id.
However if the url you use to access the page is not the one that is used internally, you will get a Cross-Origin error.
Came across this with my zola blog, and it seemed to work intermittently, but I couldn't figure out why.

Creating tensors is easy, just use numpy and `torch.tensor` to do it
```python
import torch
import numpy as np

a = [1, 2, 3]
c = torch.tensor(np.array(a)) #  c is a tensor
```

If you intend to create a vector based search engine, searching a database of assets will give you identical results if you are looking for similarity. If you want to have similarity search but at the same time look for diverse results you can use `max_marginal_relevance_search`, this is available in `langchain`, and it is bound to the vector store.
