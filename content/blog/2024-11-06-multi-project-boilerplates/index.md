## Why?

Technically when you start a new project the best way to approach it is by using the `CLI` tool of the realm, such as `svelte-kit`, `astro`, `django-cli` etc..., you get the idea. The huge bonus to doing this is that you get the best practices baked in and as new standards are created the `CLI` gets updated.

So far the frontend has been a lot luckier with the tools as far as project generation goes, every major framework having come out with their own project generation tool, some having more than one possibly due to (multiple thought camps: TODO: better way to phrase this) multiple thinking camps.

There are some backend frameworks that have project generation tools too but so far it seems to be difficult to agree on the structure. The best you can do is find a way to structure it that looks like the majority and makes sense for you. I have been building spiders and crawlers for data ingestion pipelines using `python` at first and then `node` and `go`. Even more recently I have been looking at hacking out some tweaks in some of my `neovim` plugins(that is lua).
