## Why?
Most everyone I know has got shiny object syndrome. We all want to work on the latest and greatest. I myself am part of that crowd very much. Whenever I start on a project I will never pin the versions for the libraries. That adds anywhere between 0% and 50% on top of the project timeline. The most notable example is Javascript with its myiriad of libraries. I think everyone is familiar with this meme.
