## Why?
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has been making it easier and easier to build out [GPT agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/) that make use of your own data to improve the generated responses of the pretrained models.

Agents give a way to inject knowledge about your specific proprietary data into your pipeline, without actually sharing any private information about it. You can also improve the recency of your data too which makes you less dependent on the model's training cycle.

OpenAI has improved the DX, UX and APIs since version 3.5, and has made it easier to create `agents` and embed your data into your custom [`GPTs`](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpts/). They have lowered the barrier to entry which means that virtually anyone can build their own assistants that would be able to respond to queries about their data. This is perfect for people to experiment on building products. IMO this is a very good approach to enable product discovery for the masses.



## How?
Talk about tech used: Streamlit, qdrant, GPT-4o, etc.

## Conclusions
how it went, what I learned, etc.
