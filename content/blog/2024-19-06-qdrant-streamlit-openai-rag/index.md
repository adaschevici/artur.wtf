## Why?
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has been making it easier and easier to build out [GPT agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/) that make use of your own data to improve the generated responses of the pretrained models.




There are many big players in the market coming in at different angles, every one of them trying to carve out a somewhat different path

## How?
Talk about tech used: Streamlit, qdrant, GPT-4o, etc.

## Conclusions
how it went, what I learned, etc.
